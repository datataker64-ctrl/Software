Software Overview

Hello everyone,

This software provides a comprehensive overview of your system in one place. It displays detailed information such as running processes, memory (RAM) usage, and various other system-level details to help you better understand, monitor, and manage your computer efficiently.

Please note that you may see an “Unknown Publisher” warning when running the application. This occurs because the software is currently not digitally signed. A code-signing certificate will be added in a future update to address this.

The application is actively under development, and support for Android and Linux platforms is planned for future releases. The goal is to make this tool available across multiple operating systems to help users solve real-life system monitoring and performance-related problems more effectively.

Thank you for using this software.
