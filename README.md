Software Overview

Hello everyone,

This software provides a comprehensive overview of your system in one place. It displays detailed information such as running processes, memory (RAM) usage, and various other system-related details to help you better understand and monitor your computer.

Please note that you may see an “Unknown Publisher” warning when running the application. This occurs because the software is currently not digitally signed. A code-signing certificate will be added in a future update to resolve this.

Thank you for using this software.
If you have any questions, feedback, or would like to discuss anything related to this project or other professional matters, feel free to contact me via email:
